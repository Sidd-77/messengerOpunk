# messengeOpunk

It is a chat app build in **MERN** stack with **TypeScript**, **NextUi** library for frontend and **Socket.io** for real-time communication
It has most features implemented necessary in a chat app like real-time messaging, typing indicator, creating groups, editing group members and information, and many more...
<br>
I have deployed it's backend on Render and frontend on Vercel
<br>
Backend : https://message-punk-backend.onrender.com
<br>
Frontend : https://messenger-o-punk.vercel.app
<br>
(As I had deployed frontend and backend on different platforms, it's taking a long to respond and may not work as expected. Deploy it on localhost and it will just run fine)
